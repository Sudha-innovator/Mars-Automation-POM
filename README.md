# Mars-NUnit-POM-Sudha
This repository includes the features- POM with NUnit framework, Auto IT, Extent reports, screenshot, Data Driven from resource file and excel

The project is about testing SignIn, ShareSkill, ManageListings and Search pages in MARS(skillswap) project.
This Project follows Page Object Model approach with Nunit framework.
I have used TestFixture to group the test cases related to one page.
Used Screenshots, Extent reports and proper exception handlings for each test case.
I have used Auto IT to upload a file.
